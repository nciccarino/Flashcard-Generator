// * Create a new file named `BasicCard.js`:

// * This file should define a Node module that exports a constructor for creating basic flashcards, e.g.: 
// `module.exports = BasicCard;`

// * The constructor should accept two arguments: `front` and `back`.

// * The constructed object should have a `front` property that contains the text on the front of the card.

// * The constructed object should have a `back` property that contains the text on the back of the card.
